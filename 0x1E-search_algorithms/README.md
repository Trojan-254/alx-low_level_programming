## 0x1E-search_algorithms


This repository explores common search algorithms implemented in C, providing valuable tools for efficient data exploration and retrieval. You'll find implementations of:

* **Linear Search:** The simplest search, iterating through elements until a match is found.
* **Binary Search:** Applies a divide-and-conquer approach for sorted data, significantly faster than linear search in large datasets.
* **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Examines nodes level-by-level in a graph, ideal for finding the shortest path to a target node.
* **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores nodes recursively, useful for finding all possible paths or cycles in a graph.
* **Hash Tables:** Utilize key-value pairs for fast lookups, offering constant-time search on average with well-chosen hash functions.
* **Sorting Algorithms:** Implementations of selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort, each showcasing different trade-offs for speed and efficiency.

Each algorithm includes clear comments explaining its logic and time complexity, making it easy to understand and adapt for your own projects. This collection can serve as a learning resource for C programmers and a foundation for building more complex search solutions.

**Additional Features:**

* **Unit tests:** Ensure the correctness of each algorithm implementation.
* **Example usage:** Demonstrate how to integrate the algorithms into your own code.
* **Further exploration:** Links to helpful resources for deeper understanding of search algorithms and data structures.

**I encourage you to explore these implementations, experiment with different scenarios, and contribute your own insights to further enrich this repository.**
